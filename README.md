## Learning Haskell

### Summary

Keeping my random hacking while learning Haskell here.

### Notes

My [notes (src/OkasakiRB.hs)](src/OkasakiRB.hs) reading Okasaki red-black tree [functional pearl](https://wiki.rice.edu/confluence/download/attachments/2761212/Okasaki-Red-Black.pdf).

My [notes (src/Wadler.hs)](src/Wadler.hs) while following Wadler's [Monads for functional programming](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/marktoberdorf/baastad.pdf).

Files starting with "Learn" [here (src)](src) from following [Learn you a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/).

The example [(src/Beckman.hs)](src/Beckman.hs) from Brian Beckman's [state monad discussion on MSDN channel 9](http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Going+Deep/Brian-Beckman-The-Zen-of-Expressing-State-The-State-Monad).

Misc stuff in the [src dir](src).
